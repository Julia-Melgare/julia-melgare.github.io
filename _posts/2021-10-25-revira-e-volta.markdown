This game was made in 48h during the Jogos Diversos 2021 Game Jam during SBGames 2021. The theme of the jam was "Reviravolta". At the end of the jam, the game was very well received by industry professionals who stated that the game had great potential and should definetly have its development continued! (which we are doing :) )

The game is available to download and play on [itch.io](https://clever-toast-games.itch.io/revira-e-volta).

Controls:
- WASD/arrow keys: move
- Space bar: jump
- Shift: sprint
- Ctrl: crouch
- Mouse Left Click & Drag: pickup objects
- R key: restart the level

In "Revira e Volta", you are a thief breaking into people's houses in Porto Alegre, a city in the southern region of Brazil. Your boss has given you an order to rob a specific item in each home, and you must do so without leaving any trace of your presence!

Use the mouse controls to toss items around while you look for the item. Once you find it, click on it to collect it. Before you can leave the house, though, you have to make sure everything you moved is put back into their place! You don't want to get caught, after all.
