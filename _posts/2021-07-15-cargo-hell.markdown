Cargo Hell is a 2D side scroller spaceship shooter game where your only weapon available is a reflector shield!

You are a new-hire space courier and need to get to your destinations safely, but intergalactic space pirates are on your tail. On top of that, the space mail company that hired you is on a tight budget, so your ship has no weapons! Your only option available is a reflector shield which activates while your ship is moving. If you stand still for too long, it will deactivate in order to conserve energy, so keep moving if you want a chance of surviving!

Initially developed for the Digital Games Development discipline of the undergraduate course in Computer Science at PUCRS, the game is currently at its first alpha version. It features 6 levels (5 of which are unlocked as you beat them). There is also a global scoreboard for sharing your highest scores with all other players!

We plan to release a full version of this game in the future. Some of the features to be included in the full version are:

- Even more levels, enemies, and boss fights;
- A tutorial session with dialogue, explaining the lore and contextualizing the player;
- Original assets (sprites, art and even more original music by som_dood);
- Upgrade shop where you can spend your score points to purchase ship improvements;
- And last but not least, a level editor where players can create and share their own levels using the enemies from the game.
