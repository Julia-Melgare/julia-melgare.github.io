Checkout a playable demo [here](https://julia-melgare.github.io/interactive-water-demo/)!

This application was developed for the Computer Animation discipline of the Msc course in Computer Science at PUCRS. It combines a deformable mesh that is able to interact with rigid bodies alongside a water shader with vertex displacement. 

For more details regarding the implementation and experiments executed, check out the [technical report](Report.pdf).

The deformable mesh was implemented based on [Catlike Coding's tutorial](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/mesh-deformation/) and the ripples were added by following [Minions Art's tutorial](https://www.patreon.com/posts/24192529).
