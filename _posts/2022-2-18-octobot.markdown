Octobot Adventures was the first project that I worked on with Double Dash Studios.
What I did:
- Implemented core gameplay mechanics (e.g. shoot command, destroyable objects);
- Implemented animations;
- Implemented online system using PlayFab;
- Implemented multiplayer sticker feature.

The game was developed for an educational insitution called International School. It is available for download via [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.internationalschool.octobotadventures).
