Unity Tetris game with motion controls using the Nintendo Switch Joycon, developed for the discipline of Project and Implementation of Interactive Systems for the undergraduate course in computer science at PUCRS.

The game itself is based on [Mukarillo's UnityTetris project](https://github.com/Mukarillo/UnityTetris) and the motion controls were implemented using the [Joycon Library for Unity by Looking-Glass](https://github.com/Looking-Glass/JoyconLib)
