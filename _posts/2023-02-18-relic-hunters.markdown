Relic Hunters Legend is the first large-scale project that I worked on while at Double Dash Studios. We were working in collaboration with the main developing team at Rogue Snail.
What I did:
- Worked on implementing the Challenge system of the game;
- Implemented extensions for internal development tools in Unity;
- Implemented some animations and VFXs;
- Participated in the initial development of the Treasure Maps system.

The game is available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/633080/Relic_Hunters_Legend/) in Early Access.
It also has an [official website](https://www.relichunters.com/game/#overview).
